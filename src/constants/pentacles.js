        "This suit, most often named 'Coins' or 'Pentacles', is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential. This suit represents something supportive that is available to you -- whether it be health, some kind of talent, a material or financial resource.        The Ace of this suit is usually pictured with a garden or agricultural backdrop, and symbolizes a seed. If this 'talent' is planted and tended carefully, it will sprout and reward you with a good harvest. Think of it as a seed of your future fulfillment. An Ace represents the first step to a goal, and if that step is repeated, it will cover great distances. Generally, the suit of Coins are referring to the tangible realities in daily life, but in the case of the Ace, it could be symbolizing a winning idea, game plan or blueprint for eventual materialization.        Occult tradition sometimes interpreted this Ace as representing the alchemist's gold -- the light within matter, the 3rd eye of the energy-body. This recommends meditating upon the light within, and pointing oneself toward the archetype of humanity enlightened. By practicing such a meditation, one eventually gains enough control of the celestial radiance to heal the body, untangle the emotions and complete the growth of the soul.",

It is clear that until one or the other coin drops, the final call can not be made; there is more to learn before a decision can be made about appropriate action.        This card counsels patience, so do not allow yourself to be rushed. The figure-eight image is a symbol of immortality and eternity. Its message is 'No need to hurry. You have all the time you need to work this out, no matter how things appear right now.' Implied within this scenario is the idea that changes are in the works, but you will do better to stay calm until you have more information. Everything is in flux at a time like this.",

This suit represents something supportive that is available to you -- whether it be health, some kind of talent, a material or financial resource.        A Four in this suit has been used to express the paradoxical aspect of material security -- the two-edged sword of having been well supported and protected. It sounds completely idyllic until one investigates the real demands that prosperity places upon people -- the pressure of big decisions, responsibilities toward dependents or employees, and even tougher decisions in times of insecurity.        An immature person thrust into such a position would lack the perspective to sensibly assess risks and rewards, would be vulnerable to bad advice or surprise developments, and could even put the livelihoods of loyal assistants at risk. This card also can refer to the subtler dependencies that comfort encourages, allowing laxness and self-indulgence to quietly degrade one's reserve of will.        The character this card represents needs to move slowly and deliberately if change is required, as the consequences will affect more than just her or himself.        Note: In the English decks, like Rider-Waite, we see a person who is stuck in their misunderstanding of how the material plane works. He's afraid to let go of his four measly coins, because he doesn't know he has to give in order to get. When looked at this way, this is the card of poverty consciousness.",

Instead of looking for how you can help, you may be worrying about how you are going to get paid back. Even if you have everything you need, you still feel impoverished.

This suit represents something supportive that is available to you -- whether it be health, some kind of talent, a material or financial resource.        The Five of this suit is the card of desire and gratification, expressed in classical tradition as flattery and false promises. This card represents both the seducer and the one seduced. There is undeniable excitement in the attraction of opposites; we have all had delightful moments of magnetism with a stranger. However, if promises are only spoken to achieve short-term gratification with no intent of follow-through, or the attraction appears as competition to more fulfilling relationships, the long-term result won't be worth the thrill of the chase.        The appearance of a viable relationship does not always bear out, so don't put anything of real value at risk over an infatuation. Since the suit here is Coins, this is as likely to be related to business as to pleasure. Try to remove the influence of glamour from your thinking.

The picture shows a rich man giving alms, his reputation enhanced from his giving, but without having helped anybody really better him or herself. Sometimes there is an inference that the giver will be expecting something back for his giving, perhaps sexual favors.        Sometimes this card is interpreted as referring to some kind of patron or benefactor who rescues a talented person from oblivion, but then wants to dictate what the artist works on as his fame grows. Inequality of power is generally a factor in this card, and the person being helped needs to be careful not to trade off heart and soul for a shortcut to fame or fortune. Each player in this scenario needs to examine the possibility they are taking one side or the other in an unbalanced power struggle.",
