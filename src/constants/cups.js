        "The suit in Tarot known as Cups is also referred to as Chalices or Hearts. It represents the emotional and psychic aspects of life -- fantasy, imagination, feelings, love.        An Ace of this suit in this position generally shows a hand holding up an overflowing cup, which gives forth an endless stream of water, wine, blood or soma for the people's refreshment and healing.        This card represents an unfailing source of balm for body, heart and soul. It suggests that you can relax into a safety net of love, support and communion.",

        "The Ace of Cups reversed warns of a loss of self-esteem, optimism and faith in the abundance that the universe has to offer. Stop to examine what it is that is causing you to lose altitude. It might be the mental food you are feeding yourself.        It could be that you are putting too much attention on the outer circumstances and not enough on the nurturing energy that is available to you. Retreat and become harmonious within yourself, until you feel love and trust returning. Reclaim your faith in the abundance of the universe. Make no moves or decisions until you have cleansed yourself of any pessimism and negativity that are haunting you at this time.",

        "The Two in this suit signifies a union of souls. This card traditionally describes a romantic relationship, but also includes the idea that all good friendships and partnerships are based on a natural affinity and a deep mutual understanding. As a personal reflection, it can also signify that your mind and your soul are discovering each other, maybe for the first time.        This card also symbolizes a karmic tie, often portrayed by a wreath or figure-eight ribbon twining around the two cups. Occasionally you see a symbol referring to the union of alchemical opposites (as in sacred sex), pictured as a long-necked flask twined with serpents, its mouth spouting flames, sometimes with wings. This image is from Alchemy, indicating the refining and mutually completing effect of a true and lasting love.",
      reversed:
        "The Two of Cups reversed indicates that you may be investing too much in a relationship. Sometimes this is a signal that you must stop seeking so much validation from others.        It may be that your attentiveness to those around you has overtaxed your psyche, and you have started neglecting yourself as a result. Stop conforming to the demands or narrow criteria of your partner or partners. When you undermine yourself in this way, you undermine your relationships too. You may think you are working extra hard to take care of others, but you are actually abandoning yourself. Eventually that will lead to alienation and resentment.",

Often pictured as three women celebrating their connectedness in a dance with lifted cups, it could also be called 'sisterhood', a real mutual admiration society. It points to all the benefits of harmonious relationship.",

You need to ask yourself what is so important that you would place it above the bonds of love and mutual support.        This card puts such a desirable face on maintaining the harmony in relationships that there is cause to wonder why you would deprive yourself of such a valuable asset. Try to find a way to let in some of the love and caring that comes to you. Don't turn away the possibility of harmony and enjoyable contact.",

Feeling stagnated, longing for change, the heart ponders its options ... as it should.",

Some part of you is resisting the flow of events, but you are not admitting your own part in this.        It may be manifesting as a sort of foot-dragging or unmotivated, passive-aggressive stalling.

This card is also sometimes called Inheritance, suggesting the cross-generational legacy of such tragedies. Violent family patterns magnified to a much larger scale can become war.",

Any incoherent fear, once expressed and faced, can be transformed into a manageable issue. Then you are liberated from the dread of negative anticipation, wondering if the situation will blow up in your face. You are freer to act authentically as a result of this energy turn.",

It's almost as if it is saying that you have forgotten how to dream. As a result, mind and imagination can become dry as a desert where only the harsh light of material reality can penetrate. In such a case, there is no golden glow, there is no higher purpose or magic spark.        This is a state of mind that no one should tolerate for long. Find something that restimulates your endorphins -- whether taking a long walk and breathing deep, buying a bouquet of roses and lilies for your kitchen table, or making contact (perhaps through art or meditation) with something good, true and beautiful. Take that step immediately and relieve yourself of the deadening flatness.",

Some Tarot decks illustrate this principle showing a young woman who has just been molested and then cast aside by a stranger passing through her village.        His heartless act has left her vulnerable, with potentially drastic consequences. This is a difficult card, but a realistic one, insofar as it warns against misplaced trust and unguarded vulnerability.",

You don't indulge in the kind of emotional agony this card generally represents, which may be a sign that you are more resilient than others; you bounce back from setbacks.

The defect may not be in the thing itself, but in the surprise of discovering that your dream come true doesn't make you feel like you expected it would.        This is an essential lesson in life. When you set a goal, specify how you want it to feel in your life, not just what you want to be, do or have.

This energy is exquisitely refined and fine-tuned. It may be that a sense of being grounded in reality has not yet entirely set in, such that he or she is easily tossed about by external forces and events. This person must work to achieve a stronger will and a more calculating mind, to balance and protect all that wonderful sensitivity.",

His taste for adventure is exhausted -- there is no more romanticizing of battles or travel in strange lands.

This person sometimes has difficulty identifying her own best interests in the midst of her responsiveness to others. As a result, she sometimes appears slightly unfocused or perhaps overwhelmed, filled as she is with 'spirits'. She represents the Grail Queen, as well as the Goddess of the Family.",

Neither is trying to rationalize away or control the situation.        You must be emotionally honest. Be honest with yourself, and others who may be involved in what you are going through.
